# UMinho Schedule Scraper 

Python script to scrape the University of Minho schedules pages to a JSON file.

## Running

### Install dependencies

##### unidecode

To create short names to subjects, removing accents from chars.
Ex.: Álgebra Linear para a Engenharia -> ÁLE -> ALE

```bash
$ pip install unidecode
```

##### Selenium

Used to scrape the webpage. On this case is impossible use libraries like `beautifulsoup` due the web stack used by UMinho.

```bash
$ pip install selenium
```

##### Geckodriver

A selenium dependency to interact with browsers.

```bash
# Arch
$ pacman -S geckodriver
```

##### Firefox

The browser chosen to run with Selenium was Firefox.

```bash
# Arch
$ pacman -S firefox
```

### Running

Now you can just run and watch. The scrape will be stored at `data/shifts.json`, with the schedule of the 4 years of `Computer Science Engineering`.

```bash
$ python scraper/main.py
```

##### Subject IDs and Filter Ids

[Calendarium](https://calendario.cesium.di.uminho.pt/) use a subject ID and a filterID. On UMinho Courses pages, a list of all subjects, ordered first by year/semesters and next by alphabetic order, and the subject IDs are given. This is everything we need to complete `shifts.json` and generate a basic `filters.json` to Calendarium.

If not founded, `scraper/subjects.json` will be generated by the schedule scraper. Read the [subjects_scraper documentation](./subjects_scraper/README.md) to know how scrape them independently.

## Are you facing problems?

This script use a lot of HTML elements IDs and classes, and, with the past of the years, UM can for some reason update the website and crash this script. Open an issue and we will try solve it fast as possible, or, if you have time, try solve it and we will check your PR ;)
