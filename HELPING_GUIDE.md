> The following instructions are targeted for a Linux environment, you can however use the web-based editing capabilities of GitHub.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Creating a branch

**2.** Create a new branch with the following command:

```
git checkout -b <branch>
```

Where `<branch>` is the name of your branch.

> **Note**  
> The name of your branch should follow the CeSIUM guidelines: `<first-letter-of-your-first-name><first-letter-of-your-last-name> + '/' + <branch-name>`.
> For example: `dm/shifts`.

## üóÉÔ∏è Making your changes

**1.** Move to the `data` directory

**2.** Open the `events.json` or `shifts.json` to make changes to **Events** or **Shifts**

**Understanding `events.json`**

- `title` - event title
- `place` - where the event takes place (optional)
- `start` - **date and time** of when the event starts
- `end` - **date and time** of when the event ends
- `groupId` - an ID composed of the course year
- `filterId`\* - an ID used for filtering

> **Note**  
> The `filterId` is composed of: `<course-year><course-semester><curricular-unit-number>`.
> For example: `221` (Bases de Dados).

Check out this example:

```json
{
  "title": "SEI - Semana da Engenharia Inform√°tica",
  "place": "Campus Gualtar",
  "start": "2023-02-14 10:00",
  "end": "2023-02-17 18:00",
  "groupId": 7,
  "filterId": 2
}
```

**Understanding `shifts.json`**

- `id`\* - curricular unit id
- `title` - title of the activity
- `theoretical` - 'true' for T and 'false' for TP
- `shift` - class shift
- `building`\* - building where the class takes place
- `room` - room where the class takes place
- `day` - week day (1 - Monday ... 4 - Friday)
- `start` - **time** of when the activity starts
- `end` - **time** of when the activity ends
- `filterId`\* - an ID used for filtering

> **Note**  
> The curricular unit `id` is taken from the official UMinho Software Engineering Study Plan, available [here](https://www.uminho.pt/PT/ensino/oferta-educativa/_layouts/15/UMinho.PortalUM.UI/Pages/CatalogoCursoDetail.aspx?itemId=4346&catId=13). However, you should not have to change it.

> **Note**  
> The `building` parameter should be composed of `CP` + `<building-number>` **only for buildings 1, 2 and 3**. For the remaining buildings it's simply composed of the building number.

> **Note**  
> The `filterId` is composed of: `<course-year><course-semester><curricular-unit-number>`.
> For example: `221` (Bases de Dados).

Check out this example:

```json
{
  "id": 14296,
  "title": "Laborat√≥rios de Inform√°tica II",
  "theoretical": false,
  "shift": "PL8",
  "building": "CP2",
  "room": "1.09",
  "day": 3,
  "start": "08:00",
  "end": "10:00",
  "filterId": 123
}
```
